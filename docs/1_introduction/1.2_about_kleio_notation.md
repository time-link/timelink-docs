# 1.2 The Kleio Notation for Historical Souces

_Kleio_ files are text files with a special notation designed to the transcription of historical sources. The notation was created by Manfred Thaller, as part of the _Kleio historical database system_ (http://web.archive.org/web/20130603204750/http://www.hki.uni-koeln.de/kleio/old.website/).

Although Thaller's Kleio database system is no longer publically available, the notation developped for historical source transcritpion proved very powerfull, providing a concise way for the transcription of complex historical documents.

The _Timelink-Kleio_ implements a subset of the Kleio notation designed for the Timelink database system. _Timelink_ provides a set of data models designed for handling person-oriented information collected in historical documents.

  This is how a (portuguese) baptism looks like in _Timelink_ Kleio notation:

	  bap$b1714-2/12/11714/fl.117v./igreja de sao silvestre/manuel lopes serra (padre)
	
		 celebrante$manuel lopes serra
			ls$profissao/padre
	
		 n$francisca/f
	
			pn$antonio ferreira
			   ls$morada/espinheiro
			   ls$freguesia/lousa
	
			mn$leonarda francisca
	
			pad$joao fernandes ramalheiro
			   ls$morada/moita
			   ls$freguesia/lousa
	
			mad$francisca
			   ls$ec/solteira
	
			   pmad$joao goncalves
				  ls$morada/espinheiro
				  ls$freguesia/lousa

In this example we have the registration of an "act", introduced with "bap\$" and then a certain number of "actors" introduced with words such as "celebrante", "n\$", "pn\$", "mn\$", etc...

Some of the actors have extra information  appended in line started with "ls\$".
