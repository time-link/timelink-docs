## Features

### Keyword Search

Users can type regular keywords — names, jobs, locations, etc. — and choose whether to search across all entities or just specific groups like persons or acts. Results open in a dedicated results page.

---


### Advanced Search

A separate page expands searching even further, offering tools for:

#### Name Searches

Users can look for full names, partial names, or exact matches. It also lets them filter by a time interval.

#### Attribute Searches

Up to six different attributes can be searched at once, each with optional wildcard matching. A date interval can also be applied to narrow down results.

#### ID Search

A simple direct lookup by entity ID (person, act, source, etc.).

### SQL Search

For more technical users, the page includes a small SQL text area where the user can pick a table, instantly preview its structure and a few rows, and then write their own SQL query. The results open in a separate view for easier browsing.

---

### Free-Form Search

This option searches documents indexed within the Apache Solr for the words contained within the user input.
